      <p>Hi there, I am an aspiring Illustrator based in the Empire State. Transferring from California, now I go to CUNY Queens College. If you think that was a big change, wait until you hear my life as a nomad. I was born in South Korea, moved to Tashkent, Uzbekistan when I was three weeks old. After living a decade in Tashkent, I lived in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan for half a decade and three years Almaty, Kazakstan. It was only after I graduated local Russian high school that I moved to the States to go to college. Others may think it could have been hard growing up hopping from one country to another but I would say overall it was a fun experience-- priceless in fact! If you were wondering about my homepage image, then I hope this would explained  bit of your curiosity.</p>
      <p>I have some experience in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and After Effects. As for traditional medium, I enjoy using ink pens, fine markers, and alcohol-based markers. However, I do have experience with other various mediums such as charcoal, graphite, water color, acrylic, and more. I like drawing (to keep it short) men, women, and fashion. This explains my obsession with scrolling down Pinterest or Instagram taking screenshots as many pictures that inspire me. Talking about social media, yes I do have Pinterest and Instagram. Feel free to contact me via email: iosefjung@gmail.com</p>
